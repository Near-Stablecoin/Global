About stablecoins, near-stablecoins and Global Dollar

Crypto enthusiasts probably know well established stablecoins such as: Tether, USD Coin, Paxos Standard, TrueUSD and others.

Some of these stablecoins are precisely defined with the auditorâ€™s confirmed underlying assets (fiat currencies) in the escrow.

Some of these stablecoins are vaguely defined without assets certified by the auditor.

Some administrators used underlying assets to speculate on crypto exchanges and made an estimated $600 to $800 million losses.

An advantage and at the same time a considerable disadvantage of stablecoins is their firm exchange ratio to a particular fiat currency. Which in practice means that when the US dollar is devalued, stablecoins will also fall in value synchronously with the US dollar.

The solution to this problem is near stablecoin.
   .

Near stablecoin is an instrument flexibly linked to a particular (fiat) currency.

Near stablecoin, for example, allows the exchange rate 0.95 to 1.15 against the particular fiat currency.

This means that it makes it possible to respond, to a certain extent, to some fiat currency-related adverse events.

Such a slight fluctuation also makes it possible to profit from the slight exchange rate movements, which the stablecoins basically do not allow.
